### Check

```properties
$ ./osctrl-cli check -h
NAME:
   osctrl-cli check - Checks DB connection

USAGE:
   osctrl-cli check [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help (default: false)
```

Although this command may appear a bit confusing, it comes in really handy to verify when the backend component is ready to go.
