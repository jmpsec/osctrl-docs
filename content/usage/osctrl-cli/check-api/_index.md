### Check

```properties
$ ./osctrl-cli check-api -h
NAME:
   osctrl-cli check-api - Checks API token

USAGE:
   osctrl-cli check-api [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

Although this command may appear a bit confusing, it comes in really handy to verify when the `osctrl-api` component is ready to go and the validity of a token.
