### Check DB

```properties
$ ./osctrl-cli check-db -h
NAME:
   osctrl-cli check-db - Checks DB connection

USAGE:
   osctrl-cli check-db [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help

Although this command may appear a bit confusing, it comes in really handy to verify when the backend component is ready to go.
